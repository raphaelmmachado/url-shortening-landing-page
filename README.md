## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [taildwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework

### What I learned

To follow a layout design and apply it on my project.

I learned to place svg as background, using absolute positioning.

Build this website was very nice. I could pratice my javascript skills.
I'm proud of my entire javascript code since i have been only using react.
Conditional rendering with vanilla javascript is not good.

### Continued development

I don't know if it is ok to have code full of tailwind classes.
